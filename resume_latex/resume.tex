		    Was responsible for successfully completing "\textbf{Entity Service}" project, which provides a common Application to store and retrieve \textbf{Merchant on-boarding data}. Entity Service stores merchant details in a graph database (\textbf{RedisGraph}) with the help of rationalized hierarchical structure defined.
    
	\begin{itemize}%
	        \item \textbf{Security Token Service:} Designed service for Security with \textbf{JWT Authentication}. User will get a valid JSON Web Token with role permissions and then allow the user access to the api only if it has a valid token and api-level permission.
		    \item \textbf{Merhcant Services:} Designed and developed loosly coupled \textbf{Microservices} to store merchant data and their user's profiles and credentials data in hierarchical structure.
		     \item \textbf{Sync Service:} Designed and developed Sync Service using \textbf{kafka} to keep the merchant data back-up by synchronizing data b/w different data centers.
		       \item \textbf{Messaging Service:} Developed MicroServices to send relevant user data to alert users in case if their password is going to expire or if it is already expired.
     \item \textbf{IDM-User Management:} Designed and Integrated Entity Service with IDM for ensuring that the right users have the appropriate access to technology resources.
     \item \textbf{AGILE :}  Working in agile methodology and familiar with Jira, Bitbucket, IJ, SourceTree, git.

		\item \textbf{Full-Stack Developer - StackRoute: } Designed and developed  \textbf{WorkFlow Engine} from scratch till deployment. 
			\begin{itemize}%
			\item \textbf{Distributed Workflow Engine : }Contributed to the development of distributed workflow engine (equivalent 
to \textbf{CI-CD}). The engine could be configured to automate a set of tasks 
e.g. git push, clone or sending a message on twitter, simple tasks.
